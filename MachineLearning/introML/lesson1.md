##Lesson 1
Acerous vs non Acerous

###Supervised Classification Example
* You define a feature or an example and then base your learning off these.

### Feature and Labels
* Features are things that we can observe.
  * Scatter plots of features and observations and used for predictions given the past data.

  ####Decision Surface in a scatter plot
  * Machine learning algorithms define a decision surface to seperate and generalise classes.
  * The algorithm takes in data and gives you a decision surface.
  * If the decision surface is a straight line then it is called linear.
  * Naive Bayes is a very common algorithm for a decision surface.

  The python library to use is sklearn http://scikit-learn.org/stable/
